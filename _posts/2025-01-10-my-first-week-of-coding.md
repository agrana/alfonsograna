# My First Week of Learning to Code

Learning to code has been an exciting journey so far. In this post, I want to share what I've learned in my first week and some tips for other beginners.

## Day 1: The Basics

Started with HTML and CSS fundamentals. It's amazing how quickly you can see results when building web pages!

### What I Learned:
- HTML structure and semantic elements
- Basic CSS styling and selectors
- How browsers interpret code

## Day 2-3: JavaScript Introduction

JavaScript was a bit more challenging, but very rewarding.

```javascript
// My first JavaScript function!
function greetUser(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to my site!";
}

console.log(greetUser("Visitor"));
```

## Day 4-5: Building Projects

Started building small projects to practice what I learned:

1. **Personal Portfolio Page** - HTML/CSS practice
2. **Simple Calculator** - JavaScript logic
3. **Todo List App** - Combining all concepts

## Day 6-7: Debugging and Problem Solving

Learning to debug code is just as important as writing it. Console.log() became my best friend!

## Key Takeaways

- **Start Small**: Don't try to build everything at once
- **Practice Daily**: Consistency is key to learning
- **Build Projects**: Apply what you learn immediately
- **Don't Give Up**: Every programmer was once a beginner

## Next Steps

Planning to dive deeper into:
- React.js for frontend development
- Node.js for backend
- Database fundamentals
- API development

## Resources That Helped

- FreeCodeCamp tutorials
- MDN Web Docs
- YouTube coding channels
- GitHub repositories for examples

Learning to code is challenging but incredibly rewarding. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me!

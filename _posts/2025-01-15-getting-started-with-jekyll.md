# Getting Started with Jekyll

Jekyll is a fantastic static site generator that makes it easy to create fast, secure websites. In this post, I'll share my experience setting up this personal site.

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll offers several advantages:

- **Fast Performance**: Static sites load incredibly quickly
- **Security**: No server-side code execution
- **Version Control**: Easy to manage with Git
- **Free Hosting**: Perfect integration with GitHub Pages

## Key Features

### 1. Markdown Support
Write content in Markdown for easy formatting:

```markdown
# This is a heading
- This is a list item
- Another item
```

### 2. Liquid Templates
Use Liquid templating for dynamic content:

```liquid
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {{ post.title }}
{% endfor %}
```

### 3. Categories and Tags
Organize your content with categories and tags for better navigation.

## Getting Started

1. Install Ruby and Jekyll
2. Create a new Jekyll site
3. Choose a theme (like the hacker theme we're using!)
4. Add your content
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Conclusion

Jekyll is an excellent choice for personal websites, documentation sites, and blogs. The combination of simplicity and power makes it perfect for developers who want full control over their site.

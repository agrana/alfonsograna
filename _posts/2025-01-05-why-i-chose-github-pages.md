# Why I Chose GitHub Pages for My Personal Site

When deciding where to host my personal website, I considered several options. Here's why GitHub Pages emerged as the clear winner.

## The Options I Considered

### 1. Traditional Web Hosting
- **Pros**: Full control, custom domains
- **Cons**: Monthly costs, server management, security concerns

### 2. Vercel/Netlify
- **Pros**: Great performance, easy deployment
- **Cons**: Potential costs at scale, vendor lock-in

### 3. GitHub Pages
- **Pros**: Free, integrated with Git, automatic deployments
- **Cons**: Limited to static sites (which is perfect for me!)

## Why GitHub Pages Won

### Cost
- **Completely free** for public repositories
- No hidden fees or bandwidth charges
- Perfect for personal projects and portfolios

### Integration
- **Seamless Git workflow** - push code, site updates automatically
- **GitHub Actions** for custom build processes
- **Issue tracking** and discussions built-in

### Performance
- **CDN-powered** for fast global access
- **SSL certificates** automatically included
- **99.9% uptime** guaranteed by GitHub

### Community
- **Large ecosystem** of themes and plugins
- **Active community** for support and inspiration
- **Documentation** is excellent

## The Setup Process

Setting up was surprisingly simple:

1. **Create repository** with `.github.io` suffix
2. **Enable Pages** in repository settings
3. **Choose theme** (we went with the hacker theme!)
4. **Push content** and watch it deploy automatically

## Custom Domain Support

GitHub Pages also supports custom domains:
- Point your domain to GitHub's servers
- Automatic SSL certificate generation
- Professional email addresses possible

## Conclusion

For a personal website, GitHub Pages offers the perfect balance of:
- **Simplicity** - Easy to set up and maintain
- **Performance** - Fast loading times worldwide
- **Cost** - Completely free
- **Integration** - Works seamlessly with your development workflow

If you're building a personal site or portfolio, I highly recommend giving GitHub Pages a try. The combination of Jekyll and GitHub Pages creates a powerful, professional platform for sharing your work with the world.

## Next Steps

Planning to:
- Add more blog posts
- Customize the theme further
- Integrate with other GitHub features
- Maybe add a custom domain later

GitHub Pages has exceeded my expectations and made web development accessible and enjoyable!
